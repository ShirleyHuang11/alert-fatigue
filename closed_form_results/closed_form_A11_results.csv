If V(·) is bounded and 0<β<1, the terminal term vanishes as n→∞. Thus, the value function is constant across t and equal to the infinite geometric sum: V(t) = (p¹¹τ¹¹ + p¹⁰τ¹⁰)/(1-β) = (0.2000×1.0000 + 0.4000×1.0000)/(1-0.9) = 0.600000/0.09999999999999998 = 6.000000, independent of t.",closed_form_results/closed_form_A11_solution.png,Closed-Form,"A11 (+1, +1)",True,True
